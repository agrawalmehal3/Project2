# **Introduction**

This dataset analyzes the airplane landings at SFO International Airport. The data has been obtained from DataSF, a website that tracks different types of data in San Franscisco. This data is publicly available to help enhance decision making. The dataset was received from [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Air-Traffic-Landings-Statistics/fpux-q53t). I picked this dataset because I love to travel and have been to SFO many times as it is my local airport. I was interested in analyzing the air traffic at SFO and gaining more insight about the airport itself.

planes <- read_csv("MonthlyLandingsData_200507_to_201603.csv")
```

# **Data Preparation**

I downloaded the csv file and then imported it into the Rmarkdown. As for processing, the main step I had to take was renaming the variables so that there were no spaces in them. I made 3 new variables. The first one was "Total_Landed_Weight_In_Millions." I made this variable because the orginial variable had values that were very big and would be harder to handle later on in terms of graphing and analyzing. The second variable I made was "Continent." I made this varaible because my report investigates the relationship between the aircraft manufacturer and continent. The last variable I created was a month variable which is later investigated in this report. Challenges I faced while preparing my data was the amoutn of data there is in the data set. I had to take time to understand each variable and how it functions in the data set. In terms of NA values, I dropped the rows that contained them. This is because I would not be able to analyze these rows. My data set now has 16,115 observations with 16 variables.

```{r, message=FALSE}

#renaming variables and replacing spaces with underscores 
planes <- planes %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub(" ", "_", .), everything())
planes2 <- na.omit(planes)

#Creating new variable 'Continent
n <- nrow(planes2)
planes2$Continent <- NA

for (i in 1:n) {
  if (str_detect(planes2$GEO_Region[i], "US|Mexico|Canada|Central America")) {
    planes2$Continent[i] <- "North America"
  }
  if (str_detect(planes2$GEO_Region[i], "Asia|Middle East")) {
    planes2$Continent[i] <- "Asia"
  }
  if (str_detect(planes2$GEO_Region[i], "Europe")) {
    planes2$Continent[i] <- "Europe"
  }
  if (str_detect(planes2$GEO_Region[i], "South America")) {
    planes2$Continent[i] <- "South America"
  }
  if (str_detect(planes2$GEO_Region[i], "Australia / Oceania")) {
    planes2$Continent[i] <- "Australia"
  }
}

#creating new variable "Month"
planes2 <- mutate(planes2, Month= str_sub(planes2$Activity_Period, 5,6))

#create new variable "Total_Landed_Weight_In_Millions
planes2 <- mutate(planes2, Total_Landed_Weight_In_Millions= round(planes2$Total_Landed_Weight/1000000,3))


```

data <- data.frame(

# **Univariate Analyses**

Univariate Analyses: Choose at least 4 of your variables and create univariate graphs to display them. Provide a brief description of the distribution, including more than one relevant descriptive statistic, to go along with each graph.

Questions: what statistics can you describe for a bar chart do I have to drop variables i am not using because each row is unqiue because of that

```{r, message=FALSE}
planes_ggplot= ggplot(planes2)
```

### Graph 1

```{r, message=FALSE}
#Univariate graph of Total Landed Weight in Millions
planes_ggplot+ geom_histogram(aes(Total_Landed_Weight_In_Millions), col="seagreen", fill="lightblue") + labs(title="Total Landed Weight In Millions",x="Total Landed Weight (In Millions)")
```

This graph displayed a histogram of the Total Landed Weight In Millions for each plane type. The histogram is skewed right with a mean of `r round(mean(planes2$Total_Landed_Weight_In_Millions),2)`. The maximum total weight landed is `r round(max(planes2$Total_Landed_Weight_In_Millions),2)` and the minimum total landed weight in millions is `r round(min(planes2$Total_Landed_Weight_In_Millions),2)`.

### Graph 2 
```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(planes2, aes(x = GEO_Summary)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(GEO_Summary)), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Domestic vs. International Flights",
       x = "GEO_Summary",
       y = "Count")
```

This bar graph shows the numebr of planes that arrived from a domestic location and the number of planes that arrived from an international location. `r sum(str_detect(planes2$GEO_Summary,"Domestic"))` arrived from a domestic location or `r round((sum(str_detect(planes2$GEO_Summary,"Domestic"))/16115),3)*100`% of planes. `r sum(str_detect(planes2$GEO_Summary,"International"))` or `r round((sum(str_detect(planes2$GEO_Summary,"International"))/16115),3)*100`% of planes arrived from an international location. 

### Graph 3
```{r, message=FALSE}
planes_ggplot+ geom_histogram(aes(Landing_Count), col="black", fill="pink") + labs(title="Landing Count",x="Landing Count")
```

This histogram shows the landing count of each plane type at SFO Airport. It is skewed right with a mean of `r round(mean(planes2$Landing_Count),2)`. The maximum number of times a plane type landed is `r max(planes2$Landing_Count)`.

### Graph 4
```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(planes2, aes(x = Landing_Aircraft_Type)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(Landing_Aircraft_Type)), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Aircraft Type",
       x = "GEO_Summary",
       y = "Count")
```

# **Multivariate Analyses**

Multivariate Analyses: Create at least 4 multivariate (2 or more variables) graphs to display the relationships among your variables of interest. Provide a brief description of what your plots show, including one or more bivariate descriptive statistics.

### Graph 1
```{r, message=FALSE}
#for each airline was it primarily domestic or international and compare the total landing weights create a new tibble with the airline, percentage of domestic, percentage of international, and the average landing weight

airline <- unique(planes2$Published_Airline)
n <- length(airline)

prop_international <- c()
avg_totalweight <- c()


for(i in 1:n) {
  airline[i]
  avg_totalweight[i] <- mean(planes2$Total_Landed_Weight_In_Millions[planes2$Published_Airline==airline[i]])
  plane_subset <- filter(planes2, planes2$Published_Airline==airline[i])
  prop_international[i] <- sum(plane_subset$GEO_Summary=="International")/nrow(plane_subset)

}
airplane <- tibble(Airline=airline, Proportion_International=prop_international, Average_Total_Weight= avg_totalweight)

ggplot(airplane) + geom_point(aes(x=Proportion_International, y=Average_Total_Weight))

print(summarize(group_by(planes2, Published_Airline), round(mean(Total_Landed_Weight_In_Millions),2)))
```
This plot graphs the proportion of each airplane type that is international and its average total weight. The correlation coefficient is `r round(cor(airplane$Proportion_International, airplane$Average_Total_Weight),2)` 

### Graph 2
```{r, message=FALSE}
#for each plane where did it come from and the percent that was each manufacturer
#WHAT STATISTICS TO COMPUTE??

n <- nrow(planes2)
planes2$Continent <- NA

for (i in 1:n) {
  if (str_detect(planes2$GEO_Region[i], "US|Mexico|Canada|Central America")) {
    planes2$Continent[i] <- "North America"
  }
  if (str_detect(planes2$GEO_Region[i], "Asia|Middle East")) {
    planes2$Continent[i] <- "Asia"
  }
  if (str_detect(planes2$GEO_Region[i], "Europe")) {
    planes2$Continent[i] <- "Europe"
  }
  if (str_detect(planes2$GEO_Region[i], "South America")) {
    planes2$Continent[i] <- "South America"
  }
  if (str_detect(planes2$GEO_Region[i], "Australia / Oceania")) {
    planes2$Continent[i] <- "Australia"
  }
}

planes_ggplot <- ggplot(planes2, aes(x = Continent, fill = Aircraft_Manufacturer)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Contingency Bar Graph Example")


planes_ggplot
```
This graph is a contigency bar chart. It uses the variable "Continent" and graphs the percentage of planes coming from that continent by th e

### Graph 3
```{r, message=FALSE}
#Landing Aircraft type and Aircraft body type
#QUESTION WHAT STATISTICS TO COMPUTE FOR THIS!!

#why does this line of code not work
#ggplot(data= planes2) + geom_bar(aes(x=Landing_Aircraft_Type, fill= Aircraft_Body_Type, position = "fill"))

planes_ggplot <- ggplot(planes2, aes(x = Landing_Aircraft_Type, fill = Aircraft_Body_Type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Contingency Bar Graph Example")

planes_ggplot


```

### Graph 4
```{r, message=FALSE}
#landing of international and national flights based on month 
#WHAT STATS TO COMPUTE
planes2$Activity_Period <- as.character(planes2$Activity_Period)

#does this count as formatting string 
planes2 <- mutate(planes2, Month= str_sub(planes2$Activity_Period, 5,6))

ggplot(data=planes2) +geom_bar(aes(x=Month, fill=GEO_Summary), position="dodge")

```
